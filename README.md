# Deepnet

**Multi-Layered Neural Network Example in Elixir**

Machine Learning has made amazing advancements over the past few years and it is
poised to take the field of artificial intelligence into new advancements. This fact
has led to a growing interest from developers all around as to the how's and why's
of this new paradigm.

Neural Networks are a classification of Machine Learning in Artificial Intelligence.
Neural Networks are a great way to achieve sophisticated insights from very large sums
of data. Most examples on the web are written in Python or Java. This is not a
bad thing, but in the Elixir community, we need a way to show how a neural Network
can work within our own eco-system. Thus, the reason for this project. `Deepnet` is a fully
implemented Multi-Layered Neural Network using the
[Elixir programming language](http://elixir-lang.org).

For more information about multi-layered neural networks read the blog associated with
this project at Automating The Future.
